# On chip PLL
This project simulates the designed on chip PLL to determine it's performance characteristics pre-layout.
# Phase Locked Loop
Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) are critical components in modern electronic systems, widely utilized for frequency synthesis, clock recovery, and signal modulation. Their ability to maintain a stable output frequency that is phase-locked to a reference signal makes them indispensable in applications ranging from telecommunications to consumer electronics.
This PLL design using sky130nm PDK works at supply voltage of 1.8v. The design includes PFD(Phase frequency detector), CP(charge pump), Loop filter, VCO(Voltage Controlled Oscillator) and a Frequency Divider.
